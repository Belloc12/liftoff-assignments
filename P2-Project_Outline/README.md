### Overview
Include overview here

Warhammer is a tabletop battle game that requires the use of 2 players using armies against one another. Armies are built via referencing individual faction books (IE, Dwarfs, Elves, Chaos, etc) against a master rule book. Battle can be fought at different point levels depending on the size and length of game desired. A typical game is 2000 poins which lasts approximately 2.5 hours.

And involved part of the game is preparing a list beforehand. An army will possess typically 7-10 units, each with their own unit sizes, weapons and special equipment. Creating a list is done via pen and paper, which can be laborious.
 
The idea will be to digitize and automate this process by allowing a user to create a list using a webpage, then printing the page. A user can import CSV files to bulk import armies, and the  make their selections and list off this date. 

### Features
Army list builder
Ability to import rosters for bulk changes
Can delete/update/view unit profiles within the app

### Technologies
Java /  SQL / thymeleaf / Javascript

### What I'll Have to Learn

Improved front end interacivity to have a master list of lists
